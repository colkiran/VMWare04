Pycharm(CE) - open source

Visual Studio Code(CE)

Sublimetext

Perl- Practical Extraction and Reporting Language  - special varaible

Ruby - 

Python - ready made functions

Python
------
1. Dotnet and Java

open source
-----------
source code is free of cost

	1. we can have many of them contributing towards opensource

 
desktop Application  	- python and TK(tool kit)

web application	-	MVC(Model view controller), REST API (Json data similar to dictionary) 
						Django, Flask, Pyramid

Mobile Appliction	-  Kivy

Testing 			-  performance testing, unittest, selenium

Automation			-  

ETL					- petl

Data Science 		-   Data Analytics
					   	ML
						Deep Dive
						AI

Python - three different flavours

1. Cpython		- currently using

2. Jython		- convert python code to java code

3. Iron Python - build application using dotnet libraries



Cpython - Version
-----------------

2.x
---
print "hello world"

3.x
---
print("hello world")


www.python.org - python 3.11

www.activestate.com	


Python 3.10
-----------
1. python SDK -> execute python scripts

2. IDLE		-> Integrated development Environment (editor)

3. Python shell	-> python interactive environment


In python we will make use of some operator that are overloaded
	
	+ => used for addition and concatenation

	* => multiplying numbers and printing a string n number of times



Library(os module)


Module 		: imp
function 	: reload

from imp import reload		(only the function will be imported, it becomes local to the environment)


Coding Rules
------------
#! - shebang  -> specify the path of python executable

comments
--------
#	- to create comments in python (single line)


strings in python
-----------------
can be enclosed in " " or ' ' and both are the same.

st = "we can't execute the code"

multiple line strings
---------------------
"""
we can't execute the code
we can't execute the code
we can't execute the code
we can't execute the code
we can't execute the code
"""

'''
we can't execute the code
we can't execute the code
we can't execute the code
we can't execute the code
we can't execute the code
'''

python does not use {} in certain scenarios

1. if condition
2. for loop
3. functions

instead of paranthesis we make use of indentation

example
------------------------------------------------------------
def fun():
	print("this is the function code")

	for i in range(1, 20):
		print("for loop code")

		if i % 2 == 0:
			print('if condition code')
			print(i)
		
		print("helloooooo")

	print("Hello World")


print('__main__ module code')

fun()
---------------------------------------------------------------

identifiers or variables
------------------------
should start with a alphabet or _ 

should not strart with a number


primitive data types
--------------------
1. Numbers
	a. integers
	b. float
	c. complex

2. strings
3. boolean

------------------------------------------

0101
0011
----
0111
----

0101
0011
----
0001
----


5 = 0101	

<< = 1010

>> = 0010


5 = 0101  ~   1010


Loops and Control Structures
----------------------------
control structures
------------------
1. if codition



Loops
-----
1. for loop
2. while loop


2.x
---
1. raw_input 	= accept data in the form of a string
   input 		= accept data in the form of numbers


3.x
---
input = accept data in the form of text


loops
-----
for loop is same as foreach loop in other technologies -> we rely on a collection


Problems
--------
Write a code to generate the below pattern


1 2 3 4 5
 1 2 3 4
  1 2 3
   1 2
    1
   2 1
  3 2 1 
 4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1

Write a code to generate all prime numbers between 150 and 50


Strings
-------
1. strings are immutable

TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

oops - if you dont have a setter method in the class



class Employee:

	def __init__(self, ename)
		self.ename = ename


	# getter
	def disp(self):
		print(f"Name is :{self.ename}")

	
	# setter 
	def changeName(self, name):
		self.ename = name



emp1 = Employee("Mike")
emp1.disp()

emp1.changeName('Kevin')
emp1.disp()
